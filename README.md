# Project: Private Events App

A site that allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

## Description

The goal for the project is to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.
A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

This project will require you to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names (hint: you won’t be able to just rely on Rails’ defaults like you have before.
